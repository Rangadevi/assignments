Summarize:In this video we're using summarize to finish the job and provide summary statistics

# Print out a summary with variable max_div

# hflights is available

# Remove rows that have NA ArrDelay: temp1
temp1 <- hflights %>%
filter(!is.na(ArrDelay))

# Generate summary about ArrDelay column of temp1
summarize(temp1, earliest = min(ArrDelay), average= mean(ArrDelay), latest = max(ArrDelay), sd = sd(ArrDelay))

# Keep rows that have no NA TaxiIn and no NA TaxiOut: temp2
temp2 <-filter(hflights, !is.na(TaxiIn) & !is.na(TaxiOut))

# Print the maximum taxiing difference of temp2 with summarize()
summarize(temp2, max_taxi_diff = max(abs(TaxiIn-TaxiOut)))

# hflights is available with full names for the carriers

# Generate summarizing statistics for hflights
summarize(hflights,
          n_obs = n(),
          n_carrier = n_distinct(hflights$UniqueCarrier),
          n_dest = n_distinct(hflights$Dest))

# All American Airline flights
