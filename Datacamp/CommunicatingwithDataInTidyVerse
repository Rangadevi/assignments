## Summary 

The **International Labour Organization** (ILO) has many [data sets](http://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/lang--en/index.htm) on working conditions. For example, one can look at how weekly working hours have been decreasing in many countries of the world, while monetary compensation has risen. In this report, *the reduction in weekly working hours* in European countries is analysed, and a comparison between 1996 and 2006 is made. All analysed countries have seen a decrease in weekly working hours since 1996 â€“ some more than others.

## Preparations 

This is where you will load the necessary R packages.

## Analysis

The loaded data contains `r count(ilo_data)`  rows. 

``{r, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 4.5, fig.align = "center"}
# Compute temporary data set for optimal label placement
median_working_hours <- ilo_data %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  
  
  The results of another analysis are shown here, even though they cannot be reproduced with the data at hand.

![The relationship between weekly working hours and hourly compensation.](http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_5807/datasets/relationship.png)

As you can see, there's also an interesting relationship. The more people work, the less compensation they seem to receive. This is quite possibly related to other proxy variables like overall economic stability and performance of a country.
