There are three main elements of a grammatical graph:
1. the data
2. aesthetics
3. geometrics
4. facets: plotting small multiples
5. statistics
6. coordinates
7. theme

In this course we'll dive into the first three meaninful layers. 

# Explore the diamonds data frame with str()
str(diamonds)

# Add geom_point() with +
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point()


# Add geom_point() and geom_smooth() with +
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point() +geom_smooth()

# 1 - The plot you created in the previous exercise
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +

  geom_smooth()

# 2 - Copy the above command but show only the smooth line

# 3 - Copy the above command and assign the correct value to col in aes()
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, col=clarity)) +
  geom_smooth()


# 4 - Keep the color settings from previous command. Plot only the points with argument alpha.

# Create the object containing the data and aes layers: dia_plot

# Add a geom layer with + and geom_point()
dia_plot + geom_point()

# Add the same geom layer, but with aes() inside
dia_plot + geom_point(aes(color = clarity))

# 1 - The dia_plot object has been created for you
dia_plot <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price))
